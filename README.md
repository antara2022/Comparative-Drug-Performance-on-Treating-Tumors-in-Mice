# Pymaceuticals, Inc.
During this project, I applied what I have learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset. I compared the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. To do this, I generated tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. I also created a top-level summary of the study results.

# Pymaceuticals
Pymaceuticals.ipynb, my Jupyter notebook, is the main script that was run for analysis. The data folder also contains the CSV files that were used. Using Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook, I created a technical report of the clinical study by doing the following: preparing the data, generating summary statistics, creating bar charts and pie charts, calculating quartiles, finding outliers, creating a box plot, creating a line plot and scatter plot, calculating correlation and regression, and submitting my analysis.
