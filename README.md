## Comparative Drug Performance on Treating Tumors in Mice
Analyzes Pharmaceutical Data Using Pandas and MatPlotLib

## Objectives:
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. This project generates all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.

### Step 1 - Prepare the Data
- Merge the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame

- Display the number of unique mice IDs in the data, and then check for any mouse ID with duplicate time points
- Display the data associated with that mouse ID, and then create a new DataFrame where this data is removed
- Display the updated number of unique mice IDs

### Step 2 - Generate Summary Statistics
- Create a DataFrame of summary statistics including a row for each drug regimen and a column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume

### Step 3 - Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
- Generate two bar charts that show the total number of time points for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the study
  - Create the first bar chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.

* Create the second bar chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.

- Generate two pie charts that show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.
  - Create the first pie chart with the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.

* Create the second pie chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.

### Step 4 - Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
- Create a grouped DataFrame that shows the last (greatest) time point for each mouse
  - Merge this grouped DataFrame with the original cleaned DataFrame
- Create a list that holds the treatment names as well as a second, empty list to hold the tumor volume data
- Loop through each drug in the treatment list, locating the rows in the merged DataFrame that correspond to each treatment
- Append the resulting final tumor volumes for each drug to the empty list
- Determine outliers by using the upper and lower bounds Using Matplotlib, generate a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group
  - Highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style

### Step 5 - Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
- Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin, and generate a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse

- Generate a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen

### Step 6 - Calculate Correlation and Regression
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment
- Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot
